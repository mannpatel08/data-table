🧑‍💼 Employee Management System (React)
A complete CRUD-based Employee Management System built using React + Vite, designed to demonstrate real-world React concepts such as state management, component communication, localStorage persistence, filtering, sorting, and clean UI logic.

This project is interview-ready and ideal for beginners to intermediate developers who want to understand how real applications are structured.

📁 Project Folder Structure

 ├─ components/
 │   ├─ Navbar.jsx          # Navigation between pages

🔄 Application Flow
User navigates using the Navbar

Employees are:

Loaded from localStorage on app start
Stored back to localStorage on every update
Filtering & sorting logic lives in App.jsx

UI controls for filter & sort are handled inside EmployeeTable.jsx

Editing an employee redirects the user to the form with pre-filled data

This separation ensures clean architecture and scalability.
