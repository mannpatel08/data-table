# 🧑‍💼 Employee Management System (React)

A **complete CRUD-based Employee Management System** built using **React + Vite**, designed to demonstrate **real-world React concepts** such as state management, component communication, localStorage persistence, filtering, sorting, and clean UI logic.

This project is **interview-ready** and ideal for beginners to intermediate developers who want to understand how real applications are structured.

## 📁 Project Folder Structure

```
src/
 ├─ components/
 │   ├─ Navbar.jsx          # Navigation between pages
 │   ├─ Home.jsx            # Dashboard / landing page
 │   ├─ EmployeeForm.jsx    # Add & Edit employee form
 │   └─ EmployeeTable.jsx   # Employee list + Filter & Sort UI
 │
 ├─ App.jsx                 # Main state & logic controller
 ├─ main.jsx                # Application entry point
 └─ index.css               # Global styles
```

## 🔄 Application Flow

1. User navigates using the **Navbar**
2. Employees are:

   * Loaded from `localStorage` on app start
   * Stored back to `localStorage` on every update
3. Filtering & sorting logic lives in **App.jsx**
4. UI controls for filter & sort are handled inside **EmployeeTable.jsx**
5. Editing an employee redirects the user to the form with pre-filled data

This separation ensures **clean architecture and scalability**.
